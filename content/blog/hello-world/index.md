I need a space to store my experience and knowledge that could refer myself and others to when necessary. So this blog was born.

## Why
Because if you don't write it, it will be lost. Talking with paper helps better understand things you believe are clear, but you don't actually know very well. And at the end it is a good way to contribute value to the community.

## Another React/Javascript blog?
Using React and Javascript on a daily basis is with no doubt enjoyable process that I never regret about. But like any other programming language it often challenges you with the following:
 - **complex**, but rarely complicated problems
 - **repetitive** tasks and activities
 - **deep understanding** of what's going on
 - **metaphor** (mental model) about how things work
 - **convey knowledge** to others

I want a reference place with solutions/guides. I want examples, easy to digest and on the point. Things in programming are often opaque, so I also want to understand with the help of something I already know.

*This is what the blog should be about.*

## Inspiration
It is also dedicated to React, right? So, it's built based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)'s default [starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) (with some edits) and inspired by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s [overreacted.io](overreacted.io).

## Recourses
You probably don't know me yet or may not care. A good starting point in both cases is [my webpage](https://webup.org), [twitter](https://twitter.com/moubi), [github](https://github.com/moubi) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moubi/).
